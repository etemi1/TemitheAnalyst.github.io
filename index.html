								<p>Which state has the most expensive real estate market? Do housing prices vary by state? If so, which are the most expensive states for purchasing a home? During this exploratory data analysis, i used descriptive statistics like mean and median to get an idea of the "typical" house price in Mexico. Now, i broke the calculation down by state and visualized the results.
								The result of this analysis and Looking at the scatter plot and correlation coefficient of the states showed that there's a weak relationship between size and price. One interpretation is that the relationship we see between size and price in many states doesn't hold true in the country's biggest and most economically powerful urban center because there maybe other factors that have a larger influence on price.
